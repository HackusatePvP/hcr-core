# Changelog 2023.02.a8
This is a minor update aimed to fix important issues from the a7 release. 

- Important
  - Configuration files will now automatically update without overwriting existing values or changes.
- Bug fixes
  - Fixed claiming pillar display issues.
  - Fixed SOTW command stop and start errors.
- Maven dependency changes
  - Added [java-ordered-properties](https://github.com/etiennestuder/java-ordered-properties).
  - Added [apache-commons-io](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-io/).
- Added
  - KOTH implementation has been added on.
    - Note: Koths are not fully implemented and do not fully work.
  - Lives have been fully implemented into deathbans. You can now use lives to remove a deathban.
  - GlowstoneMountain now runs on a task which will regenerate glowstone every hour.
  - Added [SignListener](https://github.com/HackusatePvP/hcr-core/blob/main/src/main/java/dev/hcr/hcf/listeners/player/SignListener.java)
    - The sign listener will handle all sign events within HCF. For example this includes shop, elevators, subclaims, ect.
    - For the sign shop refer to the [items.txt](https://github.com/HackusatePvP/hcr-core/blob/main/src/main/resources/items.txt) which is a database for every item in 1.8. You can add and modify this list to your likings. Note that every entry works like a map.
      First you want to include the alias for the item. For example if you want to make diamonds with an "s" as an alias you would add "diamonds&". After the "&" you wll have to add the item id.
      For this example the id for diamonds would be 264 so the final result would be "diamonds&264".
  - Added item database which will load from the jar.    
  - Completed [MongoStorage](https://github.com/HackusatePvP/hcr-core/blob/main/src/main/java/dev/hcr/hcf/databases/impl/MongoStorage.java) [saveUsers](https://github.com/HackusatePvP/hcr-core/blob/02c1dd4c5a0b009328cd528fbca487ae8ed8aa92/src/main/java/dev/hcr/hcf/databases/impl/MongoStorage.java#L309) function.
  - Added [FactionSetColorCommand](https://github.com/HackusatePvP/hcr-core/blob/main/src/main/java/dev/hcr/hcf/factions/commands/staff/FactionSetColorCommand.java).
  - Added [FactionTerritoryMoveEvent](https://github.com/HackusatePvP/hcr-core/blob/main/src/main/java/dev/hcr/hcf/factions/events/members/FactionTerritoryMoveEvent.java). This is called everytime a player is moving inside a factions' territory which is not Warzone or Wilderness.
- Changes
  - Added a debug toggle inside of [hcf.properties](https://github.com/HackusatePvP/hcr-core/blob/main/src/main/resources/hcf.properties). If toggled off most console debug messages will be turned off.
  - Configuration files will now automatically update new values without overwriting existing values.
  - Players can now enter their own territory with an active PvPTimer.
  - Fully removed all document (MongoDb mapping object) to a generic mapping.
- Fixes
  - Properties files are now ordered alphabetically instead of being in a random order.
  - Fixed issue where a bard would hold effect while player tries to equip a class. The bard effect would override the class effects.
  - Fixed issue when a class passive effect would override a clicked effect from a bard.
  - [PvPTimerCommand](https://github.com/HackusatePvP/hcr-core/blob/main/src/main/java/dev/hcr/hcf/commands/players/PvPTimerCommand.java) no longer requires the UUIDUtils from Yuni.
  - Fixed minor scoreboard display issues.
  - Fixed unclaim pricing. Note I have updated the price of claiming and unclaiming from to 9.75
  - Fixed mountain.txt file not creating.
