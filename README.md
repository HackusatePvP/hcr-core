# Unofficial HCR CORE
This core is not the core used for our server, however it was the work in progress core.

## WARNING
 This is very incomplete will most likely stay that way.

## Goals
To actually finish this project unlike others I have done.

Most hcf cores use every java util on maven central, I plan on minimising the use of java libraries such as Trove, Apache, Lombokm ect

## TODOS
- Implement saving
- Set up a simulated faction environment (Warzone, Wilderness, Spawn)
- Pretty much this core has nothing, so I'm going to write a 500 line todo.

## What does this have currently
Not much currently. The most you can do is create a player faction. Databases haven't been implemented yet to save or load data. 
I plan on finishing the faction system before implement saving or loading. The only thing this core really has is a somewhat finished command framework used for faction commands.

## This shit looks like iHCF
Kool, but iHCF works this don't.
