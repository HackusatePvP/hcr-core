# Official HCR CORE
This core is designed and made by me. Any utils or public code will be credited in the [changelog](https://github.com/HackusatePvP/hcr-core/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)
This is not a fork of any kind and any similarities between this and another core are just coincidental.

# Warning
This core is unfinished and untested. This core is not meant to be put into production until its fully completed.
Any and all issues you encounter will have to be fixed by you or another third party developer. Please do not create issues
within GitHub as they will most likely be ignored. This may change as the core comes closer to completion.

# Style of HCF
This core is made for "hardcore" hcf servers. I never thought I would have to emphasize hardcore in a game-mode which is meant to be hardcore.
This core will never have any soft-core features like partner items, partner packages, ability items, ect. 
This core is made to make the game-mode as hard and as challenging as possible.

# FAQ
Q: This shit looks like iHCF.

A: The structure may be similar because of how I created the faction systems. I have factions running on super or "abstract" classes which makes creating different types of factions easier.
If you compare the code they are greatly different and any minor similarities are just a coincidence due to the same implementation style.

Q: Can I use this for my server?

A: Not recommended as it's not finished. If you do end up using this for your server, understand the rights section of this file.

# Compile a JAR
Run the command `mvn clean install` in the project directory. The jar will be outputted to the "target" directory.
