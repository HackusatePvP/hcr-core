# Unofficial HCR CORE
This core is not the core used for our server, however it was the work in progress core.

## WARNING
 This is very incomplete will most likely stay that way.

## Goals
To actually finish this project unlike others I have done.

Most hcf cores use every java util on maven central, I plan on minimising the use of java libraries such as Trove, Apache, Lombok, ect.

## UPDATE
When this core can be setup in a working environment with every basic feature implemented and tested.
I will then re-do the readme file. 

## TODOS
- ~~Implement saving~~
- ~~Create logic for joining factions.~~
- ~~Create basic faction commands (Balance, Deposit, Withdraw, Join, Chat).~~
- ~~Setup custom faction events to offer an extensive api implementations.~~
- Improve existing frameworks such as command and faction systems.
- Create basic faction functions; Regen task, Deathbans, DTR, Raidable.
- Set up a simulated faction environment (Warzone, Wilderness, Spawn).
- ~~Setup claiming logic.~~  
- There's way more to add, but let us just keep it "simple" for now.

## What does this have currently
Not much currently. The most you can do is create a player faction. Databases haven't been implemented yet to save or load data. 
I plan on finishing the faction system before implement saving or loading. The only thing this core really has is a somewhat finished command framework used for faction commands.

## This shit looks like iHCF
Kool, but iHCF works this don't.
