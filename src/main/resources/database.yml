# The main database handler you wish to use. In time there will be more options but for now its just "mongo"

# Database configurations. This is where you configure each handler
mongo:
  host: "127.0.0.1" # It is recommended that you do not have mongo running on an outside network due to security vulnerabilities.
  port: 27017 # It is recommended to change the default mongo port for better security.
  database: "HCF"
  user: "admin" # Only applies if authentication is enabled on you mongodb host.
  password: '' # Leave blank for no authentication. By default mongodb authentication is disabled.
  admin-db: "admin" # Mongo authentication database. By default its "admin"

# For keeping user pruchases such as in-game lives we will use a different database to store. So even if the server resets they won't be scammed out of what they paid for.
lives: # This will use whatever handler is in place and the same credentials for that handler.
